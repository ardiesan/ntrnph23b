## Introduction
Embarking on the internship journey at the company has been an immersive experience, offering me a front-row seat to the dynamic world of technology. In this review, I aim to delve into the impactful facets of the internship program, outlining how it has significantly contributed to my professional development while exploring avenues for additional learning.

## Internship Highlights

### Mastering Version Control and Collaboration with GitHub
The internship program at the company propelled my understanding of version control through hands-on experience with Git and GitHub. Our mentor truly trained us to always use the command line whenever executing version control and not rely on GUI applications, which gave me a boost of confidence when using GitHub. The collaborative nature of GitHub not only refined my version control skills but also exposed me to best practices in team-based development, laying a robust foundation for future collaborative endeavors.

### Efficient Project Management with JIRA
The internship journey included a deep dive into JIRA, where we had the opportunity to experience handling tickets â€“ a pivotal tool for efficient project management. From task organization to progress tracking, JIRA played a crucial role in streamlining communication within the team. The exposure to this industry-standard project management tool has undoubtedly enhanced my ability to navigate projects seamlessly.

### Developing Robust Web Applications with Laravel
The company provided an immersive experience in Laravel development, allowing me to sharpen my skills in crafting robust and scalable web applications. With these experiences, it played a crucial role in the successful implementation of my capstone project. The hands-on approach to Laravel development not only deepened my understanding of modern PHP but also instilled confidence in my ability to create web applications.

### Crafting Static Websites with Jekyll
Exploring Jekyll during the internship was a journey into the world of static site generators. The ability to create static websites quickly and efficiently with Jekyll boosted my skills and emphasized the importance of enhancing performance without compromising on the user experience.

### Securing Connections through SSH and CLI Navigation
The internship program at the company facilitated an in-depth exploration of SSH, equipping me with the knowledge to secure connections and navigate remote servers seamlessly. Navigating through the Command Line Interface (CLI) became second nature, enhancing my efficiency in managing and deploying applications. As an intern, I hadn't anticipated such experiences because they aren't typically taught in school, making me especially grateful.

### Livewire for Responsive User Experiences
The integration of Livewire into the internship experience highlighted the importance of dynamic user experiences. Exploring Livewire's capabilities empowered me to create interactive and responsive applications, elevating my skill set in front-end development. Without Livewire being introduced during the internship program, my capstone project would not be optimized to this very day.

### Web Application Deployment
The hands-on experience gained during the internship expanded my skill set in web application deployment. I'm especially grateful to my mentor for guiding me and giving us a subdomain to work on. It was a memorable experience because, before this internship, I hadn't had the chance to gain such hands-on experience.

### GitHub Workflows
Learning GitHub Workflows was a valuable part of my internship. It involved creating workflows that facilitate Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). This enables developers to define automated processes for building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring thorough testing and safe deployment to production environments.

## Program Impact on Professional Growth
The internship program at the company significantly fueled my professional growth. The collaborative environment cultivated adaptability, allowing seamless integration with industry-standard tools. Gaining experience working on an intern project, such as the FST-admin ticketing system, using Git for version control, and participating in agile processes through JIRA were invaluable experiences shaping my future endeavors.

## Opportunities for Further Learning
My internship at the company has been an incredible journey; it has provided me with a lot of learning materials to explore and develop my skills. The only thing that I wish to have experienced more while being here is working on real projects. I think that it would have been a real game-changer and would fully equip me in my future career. Some of my classmates, during their OJT, were able to experience this, and witnessing their excitement about tackling actual challenges, seeing their code come to life, and making an impact fueled my desire for a similar experience. Incorporating opportunities for interns to engage with real-world projects, just like some of my schoolmates did, would undoubtedly enhance the learning adventure, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the tech landscape.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, my time at the company as an intern has been instrumental in shaping my professional identity. The challenges encountered, skills acquired, and relationships formed have collectively contributed to a transformative experience. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the company, and especially to my Internship Mentor, for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my internship. The memories and lessons learned during this period will undoubtedly stay with me as I embark on the next chapter of my professional journey.
