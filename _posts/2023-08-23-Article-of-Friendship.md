#### My IT Journey: Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Opportunities

My journey in the IT world started because I was excited about all the opportunities it offers and the good money that comes with it. When I began college, I struggled a lot with programming classes during the first few years. Coding was really tough, and I didn't do well in those subjects. My grades were bad. But I didn't give up. I kept going, even when things were hard. I made friends along the way, and as time went on, many of them changed their majors.

Now, as I'm about to graduate, I look back and remember how things have changed. Only one of my friends from when I started is still doing IT. It's been a great journey full of learning. I got to work with programming languages like C++, C#, JavaScript, and Java. These were like the building blocks of my programming skills. It wasn't always easy, but I didn't stop trying.

What makes this journey special is the friends I've made and the things I've learned. We faced challenges together, and even though most of my friends chose different paths, I remained as an IT. Now, as I get ready to finish college, I'm proud of what I've achieved. I've learned a lot, not just about computers but also about myself. This journey is just the beginning. I'm excited to see where my IT skills will take me next.

Being an intern at an amazing company is something I never thought would happen to me. I used to believe that interns were just supposed to do simple tasks like making coffee or photocopying papers for their seniors. But my experience at this company has been completely different. Here, I'm learning about new technologies and skills that my school didn't teach me.

When I first got accepted here, I had high hopes, but now that I'm in my sixth week, I can say that this company has exceeded my expectations. It's not just about the work; it's the company culture that's truly wonderful. I feel like I belong here, and the positive environment is all around me.

What's even more exciting is that I've made new friends from other schools who share the same passion as me. It's great to connect with people who are as enthusiastic about technology as I am. This internship has shown me that there's so much more to learn and experience than I initially thought. It's not just about the tasks; it's about personal and professional growth. This journey has opened my eyes to the endless possibilities in the IT world, and I'm grateful for the chance to be part of it.
