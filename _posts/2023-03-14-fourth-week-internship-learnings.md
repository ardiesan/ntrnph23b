During the fourth week of my internship with the company, I gained a better understanding of how to follow instruction in making a Basic Task List in Laravel Team and how to improve it and applying some changes but I'll try to explore more in Laravel so that I can understand more.

## Presenting the Basic Task List with Bootstrap - Day 13

In the Morning we were presenting our Basic Task List creation with the improvement of design. On my Basic Task List, I learned about how to use bootstrap in making a design of my tables and buttons. I added some feautures such as create a new task, read to see the list of task, update the list task by changing some information in task, and delete the list of task. Despite the fact that I was late. I'm glad our mentor understands and gives me enough time to finish my task. After the presentation we do the Halday because of the Transportation Strike.

### Using git rm - Day 14

After improving my Basic Task List, we were instructed to delete the contents we created and learn how to use git rm. I Learned that if I delete some files, I should use the CLI terminal to ensure that they were completely removed. I'm giving hard time this day we do the work from home due to the transportation strike and it was new to me to use a windows and it needs to download ubuntu when using a docker in windows. so it takes a lot of time to me to finally set-up in my Laravel. After that I understand and follow the instructions to view the output of the Laravel Team's Basic Task List so it was nice to see the code turns out well even if its 8 years ago.

### Using git diff and Concept of Laravel Middleware - Day 15

The following day, we were assigned the task of understanding the function of git diff and comparing the contents of co-interns. Following that, I learned about the concept of Laravel Middleware, and we were assigned a task to create a log in page, which i failed to complete. I'm having difficulty tracing and correcting the errors. After trying, I learned how to fixed the errors and it was so challenging this task for me.

### Using git revert - Day 16

In this Day, we were assigned the task of updating our reflection from Third Week and responding to all of the comments that had been left on it. I edited and updated it, but it didn't turn out well due to my faulty process. After I updated it the results is did not match the address in what the request to be changes. and I have so many corrections about the Acronyms, Consistency of Bold Cases, Statements are incoherent so I try more to understand and improve my corrections.

### Git Commands

Here's the list of Git commands we used this week.

- **git rm** - `git rm <file name>`
- **git diff** - `git diff branch-1, branch-2`
- **git revert** - `git revert <commit hash>`
- **git log** - `command to shows commit history`
- **git push** - `command to update the remote repository with the reverted changes`

Lastly, I'm having a hardtime catching up on my learnings this week, but I'll work hard to understand more.
