It is now the 4th week of our internship and we still have much more to learn. These are the things I have encountered.

## CSS and JS Bootstrap

After arriving at the workstation on the 13th day, I decided to take a quick look at my previous task list. I used CSS and JS on it. Later, after being briefed by our mentor, he advised us to use CSS Bootstrap. At first, I thought that this is another language, but it's just the same as CSS. The difference is that you have a reference online with what you wish to design or create, like a table or an input form. This is quite useful because this saves you a lot of time designing it manually, you just take a preference and apply it to your code.

## Operating Laravel on Windows

On the 14th day, this is the first time we had to do intern work at home because of the transport strike. We were tasked to delete the contents of our previous form, but copy the Laravel team's basic task list repository. We had our share of troubles but other than that, the task was done. Then, I realized that working on the Mac is so much easier than operating on the Windows platform.

## Middleware: Authentication and Authorization

15 days in and our mentor decided to give us a new task, which is to create user authentication for our generated task forms and which should contain login and register pages. When the user visits the website, they have the option to choose to log in or register. But it still lacks some security. Later on, we were tasked to have user authorization on the site which means that only the logged-in users can only be able to add or remove tasks. I managed to create the one where you cannot create a task after you have logged in but not the deletion yet.

## The Git Revert

Today is the 16th day of our internship. We arrived at the company and were tasked to submit our article for the 3rd week. It was checked by our mentor, and our work had a lot of issues. So, our mentor rejected our Pull Requests and had us modify our files based on the request or comment he has made. Instead of pulling it off only one time, we made it much worse. Our mentor then introduced us to the Git revert command. It reverts to the time when you committed and removes the changes you've made.
