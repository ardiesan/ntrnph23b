This week will mark our first month as an intern in the company. The changes we have to face was so drastic that we must to adapt as fast as we could. There were downs, and I have to stand up and continue this journey. 

## Bootstrap - Day 13

Due to the National Strike, we worked halfday this day. In the morning our mentor tasked us to utilize bootstrap css to our Basic Task List. I was amazed by how easy to use the bootstrap is, and it looks nice too. Compared to what I did last week the difference is drastic. The Basic Task list that utilized looks way more better. After that I pushed the new markdwn file I created containing my third week of internship.

## Utilizing “git rm” command and Basic Task List by Laravel team - Day 14

The National Strike was still in effect this day, so we decided to work from home. Our mentor tasked us to remove the contents of our basic task list using the command "git rm". I have noticed changes when using the command 'git rm' compared to directly deleting a file from VSCode. I don't need to "git add" the file that I deleted if I use the "git rm" command, while if I delete the file directly I need to git add it. It's really fascinating what little details makes difference. And after that we were tasked to copy the Basic Task List provided by the Laravel team, it was nice and neat to think that that tutorial was last modified 8 years ago.

## Middleware Authentication - Day 15

Our mentor introduced us to Middleware Authentication. I learned that middleware will ensure that only authorized users could access certain features. This was a new concept for me, but I quickly learned how middleware can intercept incoming requests and perform tasks such as authentication before passing the request along to the intended route. Adding middleware allowed me to implement a simple login system for my task list, which was a great learning experience. 

## Git revert - Day 16

This day our mentor tasked us to modifiy the requested changes, in the pull request we did last week in Github. Unfortunately, I made a mistake by modifying different lines in the file, including lines that were not supposed to be changed. Our mentor was upset because it is not a good practice to modify parts of the code that are not included in the requested changes. If we get used to doing this, it could potentially harm the codebase of future projects we work on. It was a bone chilling moment, but I need to face the mistakes that I have done in order to improve myself. Another lesson learned.
